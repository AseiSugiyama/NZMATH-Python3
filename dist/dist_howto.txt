How to release NZMATH
=====================

This manual explains how to release new NZMATH version.  It is
intended to be self-contained.  The release manager should take the
steps below on a Unix(-like) system.  He/she needs CVS access on the
process, and ssh access to the web server.


Steps
-----
0. Decide the version number.

   The current versioning scheme is as follows.  The version has three
   components: major, minor and micro.  Each of them starts from zero.
   The minor (micro) version is reset if major (resp. minor) version
   is incremented.  The major version changes with the base Python
   version that the NZMATH supports.  For example, all of NZMATH 0.x.x
   run on Python 2.3 or higher.  The minor version changes with the
   module structure; additions or deletions of modules or sub-package.
   The micro version reflects other changes like bug fixes.

1. Update documents in dist directory.

   There are README.txt, CHANGES.txt, HISTORY.txt etc.
   Makefile has OLD_VER and NEW_VER variables, and they should be
   reflect the current and newly decided versions.

2. HTMLize the manual.

   Consult dist/nzmathwiki.py for more details.

3. Tag in CVS.

   The files are ready to be distributed by the previous steps. To
   make them named in the history, tag them in CVS repository.  The
   command line looks like:
       % cvs tag release-x_y_z *
   on nmath directory, where x, y and z are major, minor and micro
   versions respectively.

   If you later need change the revision to be tagged, you can use -F
   option of 'cvs tag'.

4. Retrieve the tagged files.

   You need a fresh copies of files, since the working copy of CVS may
   contain garbage files.  Please change your current directory to
   somewhere else; a recommended place is ~/tmp (if you have).
       % cd ~/tmp
       % cvs -d $CVSROOT export -r release-x_y_z nmath
   These retrieve the tagged files in ~/tmp/nmath without control data
   of CVS.  CVSROOT for sf.net is (by replacing the account):
       :ext:account@nzmath.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/nzmath

5. Make a distribution file.

   Run 'make' in dist subdirectory:
       % cd ~/tmp/nmath/dist
       % make
   Then, NZMATH-x.y.z.tar.gz will be in /tmp/nzmath-build/dist
   directory (note that it is not ~/tmp you may be using but /tmp).
   For Windows, NZMATH-x.y.z.zip will be in the same directory,
   and NZMATH-x.y.z.win32Install.exe in /tmp/nzmath-build/dist_wininst.

6. Make a test distribution file.

   The tests also should be distributed.  There is no automation to
   construct the test distribution file, so do the followings:
       % cd ~/tmp/nmath
       % tar zcf NZMATH-test-x.y.z.tar.gz test/
   Needless to say, x.y.z has to be replaced by yourself with the real
   version you choose.

7. Try them by yourself.

   To make sure the files created are flawless, it is recommended to
   try to install them on your machine.

8. Put the distribution file on the web.

   The distribution files NZMATH-x.y.z.tar.gz and
   NZMATH-test-x.y.z.tar.gz have to be made public.

   Currently, we use http://tnt.math.metro-u.ac.jp/nzmath as the main
   web site of the NZMATH project, so put the file onto it.  Then
   update index.html manually, replace README.html by generated one(*)
   and the manual directory by the same files as in the distribution.

   For this step, you need SSH and CVS access to the tnt server.

   (*) It is in /tmp/nzmath-build.  If you don't have docutils
       installed, then README.html has size 0.  In that case, you have
       to manually update it.

   The secondary download site is sourceforge.net.  There is a help
   page on sourceforge.net, so the series of steps described here is
   just a rough guideline.
   1) upload NZMATH-x.y.z.tar.gz and NZMATH-test-x.y.z.tar.gz by
      anonymous ftp.
   2) create new release names from the web interface.
   3) go on to pick up the files as new release files.

   For this part, you need relese management permission on the
   sourceforge.net nzmath project.

9. Announce.

   Very few people will notice the update until you announce it.  The
   places to announce are currently the nzmath-user ML and the
   sourceforgef.net project news.  For the latter, you need right to
   submit a news on sourceforge.net nzmath project.  You can use the
   previous announcements as templates.

10. Finished.

   OK, you've done it.
