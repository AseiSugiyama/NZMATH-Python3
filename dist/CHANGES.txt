Version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1?
-----------------------
* add a constant j to imaginary.
* intializing Rational with denominator 0 raises ZeroDivisionError.
* fix a bug in real.py.

Version 0.0.1 to 0.1.0
----------------------
* add new module elliptic for elliptic curve operations.
* remove optional argument for generator in prime.py. Condition may
  be specified with itertools instead.
* add new module finitefield for finite field.  It only includes
  finite prime field at the present moment.
* add new module combinatrial including binomial and factorial.
* add issubring and issuperring to Ring in ring.py.
* add mpqs function (multi-polynomial quadratic sieve) in factor.py.
* add IntegerIfIntOrLong function in rational.py.
* add LUDecomposition method to Matrix in matrix.py.
* now you can factor a very big but very smooth integer by trial division.
* speed up real.log, and it now accepts float.
* fix bugs in rational.py, integerResidueClass.py, etc..

Version 0.0.0 to 0.0.1
----------------------
* add __long__ and __int__ methods to Rational in rational.py.
* add gcd method to PolynomialRing in polynomial.py.
* fix bugs in matrix.py, polynomial.py.
