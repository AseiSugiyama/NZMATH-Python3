version 0.3.1 to 0.3.2
----------------------
* fix some bugs in polynomial.
* add a method to culculate Mordel-Weil group structure of elliptic curve over finite fields. 

version 0.3.0 to 0.3.1
----------------------
* fix import problem, and include finitefield.py mistakenly missing in 0.3.0.

version 0.2.1 to 0.3.0
----------------------
* create a new module multiplicative.py with euler and moebius
  from arith1.py to avoid circular import.

version 0.2.0 to 0.2.1
----------------------
* include some missing files in 0.2.0.

Version 0.1.1 to 0.2.0
----------------------
* add a new module factor.mpqs, which provides multi-polynomial
  quadratic sieve method.
* add a method to culculate order of elliptic curve over finite fields.
* rewrite polynomial.py for one variable polynomials.
* rewrite real.py and imaginary.py.
* fix bug in matrix.py (reported by Justin Walker).
* many other bug fixes.
* create a tutorial.txt document.

Version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
----------------------
* BSD-licensed.
* add a constant j to imaginary.
* intializing Rational with denominator 0 raises ZeroDivisionError.
* fix bugs in real.py and elliptic.py.

Version 0.0.1 to 0.1.0
----------------------
* add new module elliptic for elliptic curve operations.
* remove optional argument for generator in prime.py. Condition may
  be specified with itertools instead.
* add new module finitefield for finite field.  It only includes
  finite prime field at the present moment.
* add new module combinatrial including binomial and factorial.
* add issubring and issuperring to Ring in ring.py.
* add mpqs function (multi-polynomial quadratic sieve) in factor.py.
* add IntegerIfIntOrLong function in rational.py.
* add LUDecomposition method to Matrix in matrix.py.
* now you can factor a very big but very smooth integer by trial division.
* speed up real.log, and it now accepts float.
* fix bugs in rational.py, integerResidueClass.py, etc..

Version 0.0.0 to 0.0.1
----------------------
* add __long__ and __int__ methods to Rational in rational.py.
* add gcd method to PolynomialRing in polynomial.py.
* fix bugs in matrix.py, polynomial.py.
